### Hi there, I'm Colin Raaen ðŸ‘‹ Full Stack Software Developer

I'm a self-taught software developer currently based in New York, NY.  I've been working in the tech industry for 8+ years in various roles.  I started out in a customer-facing sales role in business deverlopment, but I quickly found out I was more passionate learning about the technologies themselves are how they solved business problems.  I then transitioned to become a pre-sales solution engineer, where I've worked with customers to understand their business objectives, challenges, to develop solutions, software demonstrations and IT roadmaps for customers.  
<br>
I've always had a curiousity about coding, but finally decided to take some initiative in 2022 and began my coding journey.  From the first Mario wall that I built in C, I was hooked and haven't looked back.  I currently have proficiency in building web applications primarily in HTML, CSS & JavaScript, but also have proficiency in Java and Python. Feel free to reach out to me on my social channels!
