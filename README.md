### Hi there, I'm Colin Raaen ðŸ‘‹ Full Stack Software Developer

I'm a self-taught software developer based in New York, NY, with over 8 years of experience in the tech industry across various roles.  I initially started my career in tech within customer facing roles, but I quickly found out I was more passionate about the technologies themselves and how they solve business problems.
<br>
I've always had a curiousity about coding, but finally decided to take some initiative in 2022 and began my coding journey.  From the first Mario wall that I built in C, I was hooked and haven't looked back.  I currently have expertise in building web applications in HTML, CSS & JavaScript, but also have proficiency in Java and Python. Feel free to reach out to me on my social channels, I'm open to discussing technology, coding, future trends, and everything in between!
